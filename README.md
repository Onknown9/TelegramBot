It's functionality is quiet big.

 -Give neccessary information on cryptocurrencies that were read by API (If user doesn't know what was read bot will tell list of commands user can use)
 -Allows user to send images to bot which will be read by Tesseract OCR and if images contained text bot will return text of the image.
